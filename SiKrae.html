  I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
  We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
  We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
  But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
  Kristen, come right back
  I've been waiting for you
  To slip back in bed
  When you light the candle
  And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
  And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
  Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
  Think I like you best when you're just with me
  And no one else
  Kristen, come right back
  I've been waiting for you
  To slip back in bed
  When you light the candle
  And I'm kissing you lying in my room
  Holding you until you fall asleep
  And it's just as good as I knew it would be
  Stay with me, I don't want you to leave

  When you light the candle
  And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
  And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
  Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
  Think I like you best when you're just with me
  And no one else
  Kristen, come right back
  I've been waiting for you
  To slip back in bed
  When you light the candle
  And I'm kissing you lying in my room
  Holding you until you fall asleep
  And it's just as good as I knew it would be
  Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
  Kristen, come right back
  I've been waiting for you
  To slip back in bed
  When you light the candle  I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
  We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
  We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
  But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
